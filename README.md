# Material Resume

Material Resume is a material design static site generator that creates a resume-style webpage consisting of cards for different resume sections. You can see a demo of this page at the [github pages](http://tylerkrupicka.com/material-resume) branch or on my personal site.

### Using the Generator

All of the content for the site is loaded from the JSON configuration files in the `config` directory. Use the [Mono Social Icon Font](http://drinchev.github.io/monosocialiconsfont/) icon names to create icons. If you need to edit the HTML, `template.html` contains the site template and layout.

Running `./build.py` will generate the index webpage.

### Licence

This software is licenced under the Mozilla Licence 2.0. There is also a small footer linking to this repository on the page, which shouldn't be removed.

### Acknowledgements 

While I wrote most of the HTML and CSS for this site while only using the material design documentation as reference, I did use [Ruddy's StackOverflow Material Ripple](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30074246/how-to-create-ripple-effect-on-click-material-design) as a basis for the ripple effect. 

I also based the header design off of Jo√£o Piedade's [awesome site](http://jpiedade.com/).
